Testing with images from - https://links.uwaterloo.ca/Repository.html

1. Find ways to generate different types of noise

- [x] [Gaussian blur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_blur)
- [x] [Poisson noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shot_noise)
- [x] [Salt and pepper noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt-and-pepper_noise)

1. Implementation

2. Measure

- [ ] [Image difference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_differencing) between original and denoised
- [ ] [Mean squared error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_error)
- [ ] [Peak signal-to-noise ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_signal-to-noise_ratio)

3. Outcome
